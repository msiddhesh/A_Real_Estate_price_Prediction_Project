Steps :- 
Data Cleaning

    Handled missing values (NA values).
    
    Organized and created a 'BHK' column from an unorganized column, possibly related to the number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen.
    
    Calculated and added a 'Price per square feet' column, possibly for outlier detection.
    
    Employed dimensionality reduction techniques on the address column.
    
    Removed highly unmatched data points based on size and type.

Model Building
    
    Conducted a train-test split to evaluate model performance.
    
    Utilized cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for five different models.
    
    Achieved an accuracy exceeding 80% with linear regression, specifically obtaining an 84% accuracy score.
